=====================
Update Talon Firmware
=====================

*Make sure your RoboRIO is reimaged before you update the talon firmware.*

Next, update the web interface on the RoboRIO by installing CTRE Phoenix on your driverstation: http://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/installers/CTRE%20Phoenix%20Framework%20v5.2.1.1.zip

Follow the installation instructions here: http://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/pdf/CTRE%20Toolsuite%20Installation%20Guide.pdf

Once the web interface is updated the Talons should appear on the interface again. Now you can update the firmware. The files needed to update the folder should have been installed with CTRE Phoenix.
